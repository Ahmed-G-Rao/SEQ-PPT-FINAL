What is Test Coverage?

Test coverage is defined as a technique which 
determines whether our test cases are actually 
covering the application code and how much code 
is exercised when we run those test cases.

If there are 10 requirements and 100 tests 
created and if 90 tests are executed then 
test coverage is 90%. Now, based on this metric, 
testers can create additional test cases for remaining tests.
